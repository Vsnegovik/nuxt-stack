# Guide

Nuxt Stack comes in two parts:

- `nuxt-stack-cli` » Suite of Nuxt [commands](/commands/) for linting, testing, formatting etc.
- `nuxt-stack-module` » Nuxt [module](/module/) that configures and installs a suite of plugins

Though these packages can be installed separately, you will get the most out of Nuxt Stack by installing `nuxt-stack` which includes both.

For a detailed rationale as to _why_ you might want to use Nuxt Stack [see here](./rationale.html).
